# skyline

CLI tool for easily creating GitHub Apps. Ideal for repeatable and automated local dev setup. If your app
integrates with GitHub via GitHub Apps, you'll want this.

1. Use either a JSON config file or an interactive CLI interface for app configuration (great for repeatable local dev setup)
2. Works with the obscure but useful GitHub App Manifest semi-automated creation flow
3. `skyline` automatically handles one-off webhook forwarding to handle the app creation callback (via smee.io), no configuration needed
4. Lastly, securely stores the newly-created app credentials so developers can get right to work

## Features

- üöÄ **Easy for Local Development**: Automatic smee.io webhook forwarding setup - no ngrok or public URLs needed
- üîê **Secure Credential Management**: Automatically saves the new app credentials and private key in the right places, so you can get right to work
- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Flexible Configuration**: Use interactive prompts or JSON config files for reproducible app creation
- üîÑ **GitHub App Manifest Flow**: Implements GitHub's manifest flow for automated app creation with pre-filled permissions
- üè¢ **Organization Apps**: Create GitHub Apps for your organizations (note: personal account apps not supported)

## Installation

### For Users

One-liner to install globally:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cased/skyline/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run `skyline` from any directory:

### Interactive Mode (Recommended for First Use)

```bash
skyline create
```

You'll be prompted for:
1. Organization name
2. App name
3. Homepage URL
4. Description

### Config File Mode (Great for Automation)

Create a config file:
```json
{
    "name": "My GitHub App",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "description": "A description of my app",
    "public": true
}
```

Then run:
```bash
# Let it prompt for org (interactive)
skyline create --config config.json

# Or specify org (fully automated)
skyline create --config config.json --org my-org-name
```

## What Happens When You Run It

1. **Configuration**: Either prompts you for details or reads from config file

2. **Temporary Webhook**: Creates a temporary smee.io channel just for the app creation callback
   - This is only used during app creation
   - Your actual app can use whatever webhook setup you prefer (ngrok, smee, etc.)

3. **GitHub Flow**: 
   - Opens GitHub's app creation page with pre-filled settings
   - You review and approve the permissions
   - GitHub redirects back to local server
   - Tool saves your credentials

4. **Credential Storage**:
   You'll be prompted where to save:
   ```bash
   # .env file (customizable location)
   GITHUB_APP_ID=123456
   GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.abcd1234
   GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret
   GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=.github/app-private-key.pem
   ```

   And your private key will be saved to `.github/app-private-key.pem`

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: These files contain sensitive information. Make sure to:
   - Add them to your `.gitignore`
   - Never commit them to version control
   - Follow your organization's security practices for credential management

## Default Settings

### Permissions
The tool sets up common permissions needed for GitHub Apps:
```python
{
    "contents": "write",    # For repo content access
    "issues": "write",      # For issue management
    "checks": "write",      # For CI/CD integration
    "metadata": "read",     # Required for basic app function
    "pull_requests": "write", # For PR automation
    "workflows": "write",   # For GitHub Actions
    "members": "read",      # For org member access
    "deployments": "write"  # For deployment automation
}
```

### Events
Default webhook events (customize as needed):
```python
[
    "push",           # Code pushes
    "pull_request",   # PR activities
    "issues",         # Issue activities
    "deployment",     # Deployment events
    "workflow_run",   # Action workflow events
    "check_run",      # CI check events
    "check_suite"     # CI suite events
]
```

### For Development

If you're working on `skyline` itself:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/cased/skyline.git
cd skyline

# Set up development environment
./dev-install.sh
```

This will:
1. Create a virtual environment in `.venv`
2. Install the package in editable mode (`pip install -e .`)
3. Create a global `skyline` command that reflects your local changes

Now you can:
- Make changes to the code and they'll be immediately reflected when you run `skyline`
- Run `skyline create` from any directory and it'll use your local development version
- No need to reinstall unless you change dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
